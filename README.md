# Graph Search Visualization

This project provides visualizations for Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms. It's a great way to understand and compare the traversal behavior of these fundamental graph search techniques.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of BFS and DFS algorithms.
- Choose your own starting node and target node for the search.
- Observe the order in which nodes are visited and the path discovered.
- Clear visualization and easy-to-understand animations.

## How to Use

1. Open the demo in the link below.
2. Select the search algorithm (BFS or DFS).
3. Choose the starting node and target node from the dropdowns.
4. You can also choose the blocked nodes in the graph.
5. Click the "Start Search" button to see the algorithm in action.
